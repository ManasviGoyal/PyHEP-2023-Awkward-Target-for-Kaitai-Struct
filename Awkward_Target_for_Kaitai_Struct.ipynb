To interact with these unique data formats, researchers have to develop, document and maintain specific analysis software which are often tightly coupled with a particular data format.\n","\n","This proliferation of custom data formats has been a prominent challenge for the Nuclear and High Energy Physics (NHEP) community. Within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, this problem has largely been mitigated with the widespread adoption of `ROOT`.\n","\n","However, not all experiments in the NHEP community use `ROOT` for their data formats. Experiments such as Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) continue to use custom data formats to meet specific research needs. Therefore, simplifying the process of converting a unique data format to analysis code while requiring no changes to existing data formats still holds immense value for the broader NHEP community."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div>\n","    <img src=\"img/Kaitai%20logo.png\" width=\"40\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\"/>\n","    <h2>Kaitai Struct YAML</h2>\n","</div> <br>\n","Kaitai Struct is a declarative language that uses a YAML-like description of a binary data structure to generate code, in any supported language, for reading a raw data file.\n","\n","The main idea is that a particular format is described in `Kaitai Struct YAML (KSY)` language and then can be compiled with `Kaitai Struct Compiler (ksc)` into source files in one of the supported programming languages.
